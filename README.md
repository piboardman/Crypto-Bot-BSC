Welcome to piboardman´s Bot

Introduction:

🧑🏻‍🔧Steps to consider

1.You need a crypto wallet like (Metamask,Trustwallet,...)

Add your sender_address and privateKey to the example.ini file

2.Create a Moralis Account 

Add your Moralis API Key to headers in example.ini

3.Set your Gas Prices

gas -> Gas Limit (maximum to use for transactions)

gasPrice -> Gwei to use (Slow (5) -> Fast(...))
Higher gasPrice -> more Network fee to pay

4.For making the bot available, 3% of the profits from every sale go to me as support for further projects.

Please be aware that this bot is bidding on the sale. However, it could happen that the value of the crypto can still change when the bid is submitted. Since the current value looks up based on the set option and draws the decision from it.
